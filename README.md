Mythril is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses concolic analysis to detect various types of issues. Use it to analyze source code or as a nmap-style black-box blockchain scanner (an "ethermap" if you will).

Most of the heavy-lifting is being done by [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)
